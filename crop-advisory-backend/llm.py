"""
Turns a list of ALERT CODES (not raw sensor numbers) into a short, natural
spoken voice message. This is a deliberately stronger constraint than
"paraphrase this JSON" -- the LLM never receives any number at all (no
temperature, no moisture %, no price), so it structurally CANNOT hallucinate
a wrong number, because it never has one to begin with. Numeric facts go
into the SMS via a separate deterministic template (see message_planner.py),
never through the LLM.
