"""
The outbox: creates DeliveryJob rows at ingestion time (cheap, synchronous,
no I/O) and processes them later -- either from the background worker thread
(services/worker.py, real ESP32 traffic) or inline, once, right after creation
(main.py's demo/trigger endpoints, for instant investor-demo feedback).

Nothing in here is called from the /sensor-data request path directly.

Names are imported here (not looked up via config.* at call time) so tests can
monkeypatch services.delivery_queue.send_sms / .get_weather / .get_mandi_price /
etc. -- the same "patch where it's used" convention main.py used to rely on,
just moved to where delivery now actually happens.
